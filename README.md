# Wizard Click

**🎮 [Play Live →](https://meeshmakes.github.io/wizard-click/)**

Wizard Click is a fun, single-file "button website" — click the big wizard button to spawn magical effects and play a custom sound.

This is meant to be a **free starting template** for making your own themed button sites (swap the emoji/image, sound, colors, and particles).

Inspired by [lizard.click](https://lizard.click/)

## ✨ What's included

- **Big centered 3D button** with satisfying click animations
- **Local counters:** My Clicks, CPS (clicks per second), Best CPS
- **Visual effects:** wizard spawns + sparkles/bursts around the screen
- **Overlapping click audio** — each click triggers its own sound instance

## 🚀 Run it

**Best option (recommended):** run a tiny local server, then open the URL:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:8000/wizard.html`

**Quick option:** you can also open `wizard.html` directly in your browser, but some browsers restrict audio loading for `file://` pages.

## 🎨 Customize

- **Replace the sound:** overwrite `wizard.wav` (keep the filename)
- **Replace the vibe:** edit colors and effects inside `wizard.html`
- **Make it your own:** duplicate `wizard.html` and rename text/assets to create your own themed button site
